# module-2-contest-recipe-catalogue
The project aims to create an interactive recipe catalogue website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It involves displaying recipes from a provided JSON array, allowing users to search for recipes by name, toggle between veg and non-veg recipes, filter recipes based on ratings, and like individual recipes.
